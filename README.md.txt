The MPLS Dog Boarding Company in North Minneapolis is a dog day care center that is looking for a web developer that will construct code that allows an end-user (MPLS Dog Boarding customers) to enter data into a webpage and determine the cost of their boarding fee. 



## Requirements

Construct a program using flowgorithm and pseudocode that will continuously accepts dogs’ data until a sentinel value is entered, and displays billing data for each dog.  

The program should accept the **ID number** of a dog’s owner, **the name, breed, age**, the **number of weeks** the dog will need care, and **weight of the dog**.

If the dog owner’s fee is greater than $125, output a message that notify the dog owner that a 2% discount will be applied to the overall bill.

Submit the flowgorithm file and the pseudocode file to Canvas - **Do not zip/compress the folder**.    You will also need to post the link to your repository within Canvas.

#### A few considerations:
* Only publish working code to your master/prod branch.  Make sure to branch when experimenting with new functionality. 
* Make sure you save your pseudocode as a .psu extension 

## Rubric Criteria
